# SkoHub Docker Vocabs

You can use GitHub-Pages to publish your vocabulary.

**WARNING**: This will not support *all* features of skohub-vocabs, e.g. Content-Negotiation. 
When machines are looking at your vocabulary, you have to explicitly set `.json` extension after your URI. 
For html it will just work fine.

[Here](https://github.com/skohub-io/skohub-docker-vocabs) you can find an exemplary repository.
You can just go ahead, fork it and follow the instructions in the README.
Feel free to add more turtle files with SKOS models to it, they will all be served and published.
